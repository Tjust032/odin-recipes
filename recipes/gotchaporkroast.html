    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Gotcha Pork Roast is a legendary dish from the anime Food Wars!, crafted by protagonist Soma Yukihira. Despite its name, it contains no actual pork roast—it's a clever nigh-vegetarian creation made with mashed potatoes, mushrooms, onions, and seasonings, wrapped in thick slices of bacon to mimic the look and taste of a traditional pork roast. When cut open, it bursts with umami flavor and buttery texture, impressing even the harshest culinary critics. A true underdog dish with a surprising punch!</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>

    <strong><em>Gotcha Pork Roast</em></strong>

    <ul>
        <li>300 g potato peeled and cut in quarters</li>
        <li>water for boiling</li>
        <li>1 tsp salt</li>
        <li>1 pinch ground black pepper</li>
        <li>1 clove garlic</li>
        <li>2 sprig fresh rosemary</li>
        <li>50 ml whole milk</li>
        <li>2 tbsp butter half mixed into the potatoes, half for frying the onions and mushrooms</li>
        <li>1 tsp Chinese-style chicken bouillon powder</li>
        <li>½ tbsp Worcestershire sauce</li>
        <li>100 g onion finely diced</li>
        <li>50 g king oyster mushroom (eryngii) finely diced</li>
        <li>3 cloves garlic finely diced</li>
        <li>1 tsp grated parmesan cheese powdered or finely grated</li>
        <li>1 pinch dried parsley</li>
        <li>8 slices bacon preferably streaky, long pieces work best</li>
    </ul>

    <strong><em>Red Wine Sauce</em></strong>

    <ul>
        <li>150 ml red wine</li>
        <li>1 tbsp Japanese soy sauce (koikuchi shoyu)</li>
        <li>1 tbsp mirin</li>
        <li>1 tsp sugar</li>
        <li>1 tbsp butter</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps to Make</h2>
    <ol>
        <strong>Gotcha Pork Roast</strong>

        <li>Peel and cut 300 g potato. Place them inside a large pot and fill with cold water until the potatoes are fully submerged. Add 1 tsp salt, 1 pinch ground black pepper, 1 clove garlic and one sprig of rosemary to the pot and boil for 15-20 minutes or until the potatoes are soft enough to mash.</li>
        <li>While you are waiting for the potatoes, heat a frying pan on medium and add half of the butter and and ½ tbsp Worcestershire sauce. Once the butter is melted, add 100 g onion and fry until slightly softened.</li>
        <li>Add 3 cloves garlic and 50 g king oyster mushroom (eryngii) and fry everything together. Once the onions are soft translucent, remove the pan from the heat.</li>
        <li>Once the potatoes are cooked, drain the water and discard the rosemary and garlic clove. Transfer the potatoes to a large mixing bowl and mash until there are no lumps.</li>
        <li>Add 50 ml whole milk and 2 tbsp butter to a heatproof bowl and heat in the microwave until the butter has melted. Add 1 tsp Chinese-style chicken bouillon powder and mix until dissolved.</li>
        <li>Pour the mixture into the potatoes and mix until smooth and evenly distributed.</li>
        <li>Transfer the contents of the frying pan to the bowl of mashed potato along with 1 tsp grated parmesan cheese and a sprinkle of 1 pinch dried parsley. Mix until all the ingredients are evenly distributed, cover the bowl so the mixture doesn't dry out and then leave to cool to room temperature.</li>
        <li>Take a sheet of plastic wrap and place the mixture in the middle. Shape into a thick cylinder and firmly wrap, then chill in the fridge for about 30 minutes.</li>
        <li>Serve hot and enjoy!</li>

        <strong>Assembling and Baking</strong>
        <li>Preheat your oven to 200 °C (392 °F).</li>
        <li>Remove the mashed potato from the plastic and wrap with 8 slices bacon. I recommend wrapping the ends first and then work your way to the middle, ensuring there are no gaps.</li>
        <li>Secure the bacon with butchers twine and place 1 sprig of fresh rosemary on the top.</li>
        <li>Transfer the gotcha pork roast to a roasting pan and place a sprig of fresh rosemary in the middle. Slide the pan into the oven on the top shelf and bake for 20 minutes or until the bacon is golden.</li>

        <strong>Red Wine Sauce</strong>
        <li>Heat a small saucepan on medium and add 1 tbsp butter.</li>
        <li>Once the butter is melted, add 150 ml red wine, 1 tbsp Japanese soy sauce (koikuchi shoyu), 1 tbsp mirin and 1 tsp sugar. Boil for a few minutes and then remove from the heat. Reheat right before serving if preferred.</li>

        <strong>Serving</strong>
        <li>Take the gotcha pork roast out from the oven and rest for a few minutes before cutting off the butchers twine and transferring it to a serving plate. Drizzle with the red wine sauce.</li>
        <li>Serve hot and enjoy!</li>
    </ol>
