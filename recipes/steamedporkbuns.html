    <h2>Ingredients</h2>

    <ul>
        <li>1 ½ tsp yeast</li>
        <li>¾ cup warm water</li>
        <li>¼ cup canola oil</li>
        <li>2 ¼ cups all-purpose flour</li>
        <li>¾ cup cornstarch</li>
        <li>2 tsp baking powder</li>
        <li>¼ cup sugar</li>
        <li>2 tsp salt</li>
    </ul>

    <em>Filling</em>

    <ul>
        <li>¾ lb ground beef</li>
        <li>½ lb ground lamb</li>
        <li>½ onion, finely chopped</li>
        <li>4 scallions, finely chopped</li>
        <li>3 dried shiitakes, rehydrated and finely chopped</li>
        <li>2 inch piece of ginger, grated</li>
        <li>2 garlic cloves, minced</li>
        <li>1 tbsp soy sauce</li>
        <li>2 tbsp shaoxing wine, chinese cooking wine (can substitute with dry sherry)</li>
        <li>1 tsp sesame oil</li>
        <li>1 tsp fish sauce</li>
        <li>1 tsp chinese five spice</li>
        <li>2 tsp sugar</li>
        <li>1 tsp salt</li>
        <li>2 tsp pepper</li>
        <li>1 tbsp cornstarch</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps to Make</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Mix the yeast, water, and canola oil. Allow this to rest for 5 minutes or until the yeast becomes active. Combine the flour, cornstarch, baking powder, sugar, and salt in a large bowl. Slowly mix in the liquid with the flour. Mix until it all comes together.</li>
        <li>Transfer to a lightly floured surface and knead for 3 minutes. Place the dough in an oiled bowl and cover. Let it rest until it doubles in size, about 2 hours.</li>
        <li>Combine all the ingredients for the filling in a bowl until just mixed. Do not overwork the filling! Split the dough into 10 equal round pieces. Place in the freezer until you are ready to form the bao.</li>
        <li>When you are ready to make the bao, place water in a pot with a steamer basket and bring to a boil. Punch the dough and roll out into a long tube. </li>
        <li>Split into 10 equal pieces and form into balls. Take a portion and roll out to about 6 inches wide. Avoid making it too thin. Add one of the meat balls on top.</li>
        <li>Pleat the buns until sealed. Place on top of a small piece of parchment paper and then place in a steam basket.</li>
        <li>Make sure the bao aren't touching. Once the water is boiling, place the steamers on top of the pot and steam for 18 minutes.</li>
        <li>When ready to serve, cook the ramen following the instructions on the packaging. Divide the broth into six bowls, then add the noodles, pork, bamboo shoots, soy-marinated eggs, and green onions.</li>
        <li>Serve hot and enjoy!</li>
    </ol>
